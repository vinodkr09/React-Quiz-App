# Project Setup
The process began with setting up the ReactJS project using "npm create vite @latest", followed by installing dependencies.

# Components
A quiz component was designed with HTML structure for titles, questions, options, and buttons. CSS was applied for layout and aesthetics, including margins, background colors, and fonts.

# State Management
State variables were established for index and questions, allowing dynamic display based on user interactions.

# Functionality
The app included functionality to check answers, lock options to prevent multiple selections, and highlight correct answers when incorrect choices were made. The "next" button enabled navigation to subsequent questions, updating the score based on correctness.

# Reset Features
A reset function was implemented to clear the quiz state, reset variables, and display the final score. This was linked to a button for user interaction.

# User Experience Enhancements
Visual feedback was provided through CSS classes for correct and wrong answers, improving the user interface and overall experience.



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.co
m/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
Visual feedback was provided through CSS classes for correct and wrong answers, improving the user interface and overall experience.
